This is a bit out of KISS for a kind of simple game 
Just showing that I understand some things :)
I tried to write the code so I can scale it in the future :)

This solution contains:
- single entry point;
- DI(VContainer);
- (pseudo)MVC;
- structured hierarchy (I hope)
- a few Unit tests
- BG change via Addressables
- Scoreboard (JSON)
